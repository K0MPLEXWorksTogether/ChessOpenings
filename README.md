# ChessOpenings
A place where I store my analysis of all possible chess openings I explore.

- Traditionally, we always start a chess game with either `1e4`, or `1d4`, with very clear intentions to develop towards the center.
- Another great option is the flank, `1c4`, or `1Nf3`, which simply allows you to command the center from the sidelines, hence known as the flank.
- `1g3`, `1b3`, `1Nc6`, `1f4` are primitive and old, and have very niche usecases.
