# A Brief Of 1d4

- If you play 1e4, and expect the traditionally 1..e5 response, then it is customary to attack the undefended pawn, with Nf3, or an aggressive f4. Thus, making your intentions to play a simple yet aggresive game very clear. This sets 1d4 as the counter, the slow and strategic play.

- 1d4 d5, does not permit an undefended pawn, although pressure can be built up by the center with a strong 2c4, which leads to a more slow and positionally demanding game. This game is not similar to the situation after 1e4 e5, 2Nf3 (or) 2f4.

- Black's standard response to 1d4 can be 1..d5. An important change can occur if White plays 2c4, known as the `Queen's Gambit`. Black response branches out to 3 choices, `Queen's Gambit Declined (2..e6)`, or `Slav Defence (2..c6)`, and finally `Queen's Gambit Accepted (2..dxc4)`.

- Unorthodoxically, Black can many more options for 2c4, and White also has many other options other than the 2c4.

- Black can also play 1d4 with another strong alternative. In the starting, it was analyzed to be a retreat to Queen's Gambit Declined, with the move structure `1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5`, and thus largely ignored.

- Later, after deeper analysis, it was found that 1..Nf6, can be used to generate a wide variety of possibilities with different intentions. The most simplest of which is the `Nimzo Indian Defence (1. d4 Nf6, 2. c4 e6, 3. Nc3 Bb4)`, instead of responding with 3..d5.

- If White switches play of 3. Nc3, to 3. Nf3, Black has 2 major options open, One, the `Queen's Indian Defence (3..b6)`, or `Bogo Indian Defence (3..Bb4+)`. These 3 options are very solid as an alternative to 1..d5.

- Another loyal alternative in Black's response is 2..g6, leading to 2 very important opening lines, One, `Kings Indian Defence (1. d4 Nf3 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7)`, or `Gr√ºnfeld Defense (1. d4 Nf3 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5)`.

- Another unconventional move that Black can respond with is `Benoni Defence (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5)`. This opening is extremely diverse, and thus challenges the though process of the opponent.

- The last and final resort for Black is the alternative to play `Dutch Defence (1. d4 f5)`. The fundamental idea behind these first move responses for Black is to prevent White from occupying a very strong `ideal central pawn-formation`.

- An ideal central pawn formation does not nessarily mean good. Rather than preventing White from getting to this position, it is more important to consider the possibilities that White enjoys in this formation, by setting up a very good base for the rest of the central middlegame, or denies Black's positional play.

- A weak ideal central pawn formation simply loses its structure by attacks. Thus, black is also allowed to allow White build this center, thus clearly stating intentions of attacking it later.  The major thoughts of school in this direction are 1..e6, 1..d6 and 1..g6.
